Awareness coordinates shared repositories. Treat its ledger as coordination evidence, not code truth.
- Automatic model-facing output is limited to terse state-change signals and safety or verification blocks. A signal never embeds ledger contents: inspect the relevant Awareness view only when it can change the next action, then continue.
- On an overlap signal, inspect peers or ownership before editing. On a general state-change signal, use attend or a targeted message, handoff, or memory read; treat every retrieved row as a lead until verified.
- Plan owns session and shared plans, task projection, observed check receipts, and completion debt. Do not duplicate those concerns or invent results.
- Advisory presence is automatic, and mutation-time peer locks are enforced automatically. Use lock only for exceptional non-mergeable exclusivity; inspect or wait on conflict, message when needed, and release it.
- Inspect peers or ownership only when shared state can change the next action. Use message for overlap, blockers, or decisions; use memory only when verified learning can change the approach. Never edit through a peer lock or take over another owner.
