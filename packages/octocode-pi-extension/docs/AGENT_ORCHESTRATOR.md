# Agent Orchestrator

`@octocodeai/pi-extension` implements worker orchestration inside Pi's extension/SDK surfaces. It does not fork Pi.

## Pi SDK mapping

| Need | Pi surface | Octocode implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Ordered lifecycle behavior | `pi.on(...)` extension hooks | `src/hook-composer.ts` middleware per event |
| Worker subprocesses | Pi CLI/RPC mode | `spawnRpcAgent` launches `pi --mode rpc` |
| Worker tools | SDK/CLI tool allowlists | `buildPiArgs` plus recursive tool stripping |
| User controls | `pi.registerCommand` | `/octocode-agents` |
| Lightweight live UX | toolbar footer segments | active/blocked/failed worker counts (`ui-extras.ts`) |
| Richer live UX | `ctx.ui.setWidget` | below-editor worker ledger |
| Session cleanup | `session_shutdown` hook | kill active workers and clear status/widget |

## Runtime flow

1. `wireOctocodePiExtension` creates a hook composer and registers existing Pi lifecycle hooks through it. `tool_call` middleware is fail-safe: a thrown middleware error returns `{ block: true, reason }`.
2. The public `agent` facade maps typed, browser, and custom profiles to `spawnRpcAgent`.
3. Spawn policy runs before process creation. Capacity blocks; packet/model/tool issues warn.
4. The worker runs isolated Pi RPC with recursive worker tools excluded.
5. RPC messages update the in-memory worker record, ledger events, active tool, and normalized handback.
6. `agent` lifecycle queries and `/octocode-agents` read the ledger; they never expose process handles.
7. `session_shutdown` kills active workers and clears the Octocode agent UI.

## UX contract

- `/octocode-agents help` shows examples, lifecycle hints, and id-prefix guidance.
- `/octocode-agents` and `/octocode-agents list` show the in-session ledger.
- `/octocode-agents status` refreshes footer/widget state.
- `/octocode-agents inspect <id-or-prefix>` shows one worker's full status and normalized handback.
- `/octocode-agents kill <id-or-prefix>` terminates one worker.
- `/octocode-agents kill-all` terminates all non-terminal workers.
- `/octocode-agents prune` removes terminal worker records from the in-session ledger.
- `/octocode-agents hide` clears the footer/widget for the session.

Slash completions include per-subcommand descriptions so users can discover actions without opening this document.

Worker handbacks are parsed from typed prefixes such as `[EVIDENCE]`, `[CONFIDENCE]`, `[BLOCKED]`, `[DONE]`, and `[FAILED]`. Unstructured output remains available, but normalized handbacks are the default UX because they are smaller and easier for the parent agent to verify.

## Policy contract

The default policy is warning-first. It warns when a worker packet omits recommended sections, when fan-out is high, when recursive tools are requested, or when a Claude/custom-provider-looking model omits `provider`. It blocks only when the active worker cap is reached, before any subprocess is created. Operators can tune caps with `OCTOCODE_AGENT_MAX_ACTIVE` and `OCTOCODE_AGENT_WARNING_ACTIVE`; invalid or non-positive values are ignored.

## Awareness identity

Workers inherit a child `OCTOCODE_AGENT_ID` shaped as `<parent>:worker:<short-id>`. The mapping is stored only in the in-session ledger. Durable Awareness writes for raw worker output are deferred until privacy/storage review accepts them.

## Rollback

The rollback path is extension-local: remove command/status/widget registration, bypass the hook composer by registering hooks directly, and keep the existing `spawnRpcAgent` worker path. No Pi fork or Pi core migration is required.
